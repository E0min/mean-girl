                    <h2 class="article-heading">A Journey of Adventure Filmed in the Desert&mdash;<br>The Spectacle of Cinema Revealed by the &ldquo;Real&rdquo;</h2>

                    <p>Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once declared, &ldquo;I would believe only in a god who could dance.&rdquo;
                    It was a paradoxical way of saying that only what affirms human freedom can become a true form of faith.
                    By that logic, how should we understand the god who chooses the dancers that fill Sirat?
                    Winner of the Jury Prize at the 78th Cannes Film Festival,
                    the film also claimed another trophy: Best Soundtrack.
                    This award recognizes the cinematic achievement forged
                    by the experimental music that echoes across the desert.
                    In the film, that music becomes nothing less than an electronic requiem &mdash;
                    a lament that consoles the death and despair drifting through the vast sands.
                    God and music, human fate and the desert. Somewhere in between them stands Sirat,
                    a film that has stunned audiences around the world since its first screening in Cannes.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-subheading">People Who Keep Dancing at the End of the World</h3>

                    <p>Sirat refers, in Islam, to the bridge that connects this world to the afterlife.
                    The film opens with a chilling warning tied to that place:
                    &ldquo;Let those who seek to cross beware.
                    The path is thinner than a strand of hair and sharper than the edge of a blade.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>As the frailty of humanity&mdash;so earnestly reaching for salvation&mdash;begins to feel almost awkward,
                    the screen soon opens onto a vast desert, clouds of dust rising into the air.
                    Amid the frantic movements of workers hauling and stacking massive, heavy objects,
                    the imposing presence of giant speakers slowly comes into view.</p>

                    <figure class="article-image">
                        <img src="../../images/page/editors_note/sirat_scene_1.png" alt="Sirāt scene">
                    </figure>

                    <p>From rows of speakers stacked against the backdrop of steep canyons, electronic music pours out &mdash;
                    low, pounding beats that throb against the heart. It is the beginning of a party that goes on day and night.
                    A rave is a gathering where people dance to electronic music in large spaces like warehouses or clubs.
                    The ravers who embrace this culture and roam in pursuit of
                    alternative communal living surrender themselves,
                    as one character puts it, to &ldquo;music not meant to be listened to, but to be danced to.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Sirat opens with the fastest and most effective passage between the movie theater and the desert rave.
                    That is also why every raver in the film is played not by professional actors, but by real ravers.
                    As crowds fall into ecstatic,
                    self-forgetting movement&mdash;dancing freely to their own rhythms, day and night&mdash;
                    two strangers who seem utterly out of place appear,
                    and Sirat truly begins.</p>

                    <p>They are Luis (Sergi L&oacute;pez), who has come in search of his daughter who left home to attend a rave,
                    and his young son Esteban (Bruno N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Arjona), who have wandered all the way here.</p>

                    <p>While the party in the desert continues, the outside world begins to feel as though war has broken out.
                    Lines of military transport vehicles carrying civilians heighten the atmosphere of unease.
                    Still, neither the will to dance nor the determination to find family is easily broken.
                    When a group led by Jade (Jade Oukid) breaks away from the convoy to head toward another desert rave,
                    Luis and Esteban&mdash;having no other option&mdash;follow them.
                    As the truck carrying them races through the wasteland
                    with no clear destination, the radio broadcasts reports of civilians trying to cross borders and statements
                    from international organizations.</p>

                    <p>With the end of the world seemingly just inches away, they do not stop&mdash;
                    even in a barren landscape where nothing but dust fills the air.</p>

                    <figure class="article-image">
                        <img src="../../images/page/editors_note/sirat_scene_2.png" alt="Sirāt scene">
                    </figure>

                    <p>The desert of Sirat passes through the post-apocalyptic imagination embodied by the Mad Max series,
                    yet becomes a nomads&rsquo; realm that reconfigures the harshness of the
                    Western into an entirely different landscape.
                    It overwhelms not through grandeur or beauty,
                    but through the opposite: an indifferent, boundless vastness.
                    Its immensity is so extreme that it begins to feel almost like outer space.
                    Within it, the characters&rsquo; goals &mdash; to reach another rave, to find their family &mdash; slowly begin to fade.
                    The desert road grows ever more treacherous, to the point of separating life from death,
                    yet they keep moving forward. There is no other choice.</p>

                    <figure class="article-image">
                        <img src="../../images/page/editors_note/sirat_scene_3.png" alt="Sirāt scene">

                    <h3 class="article-subheading">Confronting the Fragility of Life and a Cruel Fate</h3>

                    <p>As the journey continues,
                    a loose sense of solidarity begins to form between Jade&rsquo;s group and Luis and his son.
                    Even without any shared interests, the simple acts of sharing food and fuel,
                    of offering compassion and help, become their oasis.
                    The humanity they show by refusing to betray one another gives the audience a moment of reassurance.
                    Though the characters&rsquo; individual backstories are never fully spelled out,
                    the bodies of the ravers &mdash; some missing arms or legs &mdash; begin to reveal the lives they have lived.</p>

                    <p>From this point on, however, director Oliver Laxe deliberately turns against the audience&rsquo;s expectations.
                    A succession of tragedies, each defying prediction, comes crashing down with shocking force.
                    The desert on which these people now stand &mdash;
                    freed from all social and cultural systems that once surrounded them &mdash;
                    becomes a testing ground where only two paths remain clear: life or death.
                    Caught in the relentless pulse of the music, the roar of engines, and the threatening howl of the wind,
                    the sudden arrival of silence becomes Sirat&rsquo;s most ultimate form of terror.</p>

                    <p>In the face of unrelenting suffering, everyone turns to God &mdash; yet neither recognition nor mercy appears.
                    If a god does exist in Sirat, it is surely one that dispenses only merciless and cruel punishment.
                    The characters become beings who have entrusted their fate to a roll of the dice,
                    and the desert begins to resemble a vast purgatory that imprisons them.
                    Only then does the truth sink in: this is a path thinner than a strand of hair and sharper than a blade.</p>

                    <p>Life is cruel precisely because even what lies right before our eyes cannot be predicted &mdash;
                    and that, too, is human destiny.
                    We try to protect ourselves by inventing chains of cause and effect to explain the incomprehensible,
                    yet not every shape of life can be accounted for in this way. Death, above all, defies it.
                    Luis&rsquo;s journey, as he slowly comes to accept all of this,
                    begins to resemble that of a broken hero who has lost everything.
                    As the desert once again transforms into a spiritual and mythic landscape, the rave music &mdash;
                    once nothing but noise &mdash; begins to sound like music to Luis as well.
                    The dancing bodies now seem like rituals that expose pain and resist the fragility of life.</p>

                    <p>And yet this is not a film that surrenders to the defeatist idea that everything is governed
                    by an uncontrollable fate.
                    On the contrary, it speaks more clearly about life in the face of suffering and death.
                    Because life is unpredictable,
                    we must endure and cross the barren desert and keep moving forward.
                    Even when an age of chaos and apocalypse arrives,
                    we must not stop. Rather than standing still in fear of the death beneath our feet,
                    we must dance &mdash; even if only a dance of oblivion &mdash;
                    to confront our pain. What becomes clear, above all, is that we must not stop.</p>

                    <p>The act of filming this movie in a real desert,
                    facing sandstorms with a film camera in hand, is itself a path of adventure beyond safe choices.
                    Space, music, and a story designed to shock all exist to push cinematic immersion to its extreme.
                    In an age where nearly everything the human mind can imagine can be rendered as an image,
                    the spectacle that only the &ldquo;real&rdquo; can create &mdash; as in this film&rsquo;s experiment &mdash;
                    may be the cinema&rsquo;s final proving ground.</p>
